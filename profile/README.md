## Hi there 👋

[Moose](https://github.com/moosetechnology/Moose) is a platform for software analysis.

It allows to represent a software system in a model, and to query, manipulate, transform, and visualize this model.

Moose is based on [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) and is open source under BSD/MIT.

Have a look at the [wiki](https://modularmoose.org/moose-wiki/) and the latest [posts](https://modularmoose.org/posts/).
